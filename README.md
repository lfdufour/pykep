This fork implements the possibility to have a more realistic solar powered electrical propulsion, where the maximum thrust delivered by the engines depends on the distance of the spacecraft to the sun.

PyKEP
=====

PyKEP is a scientific library providing basic tools to perform research in interplanetary trajectory design or, more generally, in mission analysis. Algorithmic efficiency is a main focus of the library, which is written in C++ and exposed to Python using the boost::python library. At the library core is the implementation of an efficient solver for the multiple revolutions Lambertâ€™s problem, objects representing the Sims-Flanagan low-thrust model, efficient Keplerian propagators, Taylor-integrators and more ...
